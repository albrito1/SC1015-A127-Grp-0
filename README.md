# SC1015-A127-Grp8

## ðŸš€ About

This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on Walmart Sales from [Walmart Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/walmart-dataset). For detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in order from:

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

- What are the different predictive modelling we can use? (In the case of our dataset, Walmart Sales)
- Are the models really reliable? 
- Do they have any weaknesses? 
- Which predictive modelling is the most reliable?

## ðŸ“ˆ Models Used

1. Lasso Linear Regression
2. Ridge Linear Regression
3. Elastic Net Regression
4. Polynomial Regression

## ðŸ’¥ Conclusion!

- As shown in the comparison table, we can see that the Polynomial Regression (PNR) model has the highest train R^2 accuracy, yet its test R^2 is negative. Therefore, we cannot use that particular model in this case, and will have to look for the next highest R^2 value.
- Both the train and test R^2 value between Lasso Linear Regression (LLR) & Ridge Linear Regression (RLR) is very close, with LLR taking the lead. That would indicate both models are more suitable for our (insert problem statement here) prediction.


## ðŸ’— What did we learn from this project?

- Improving and cleaning of datasets with
- Using plotly as a tool for interactive visualisations
- Lasso and Ridge Linear Regression
- Elastic Net Regression
- The difference between the predictive models
